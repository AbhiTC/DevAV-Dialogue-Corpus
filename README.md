# A Dynamic Goal Adapted Task Oriented Dialogue Agent

The primary task of any goal-oriented dialogue agent is to accomplish a user's task with utmost user satisfaction. Existing virtual agents assume that the end-user will always have a predefined task goal, which will be served after filling the corresponding intent and slots. However, in real-life, users do not always have a generic pre-known task goal, i.e., they determine their precise task goal dynamically based on their utility value and the agent's serving capability. They may upgrade/downgrade/update their goal components in real-time to maximize their utility value. This assumption emphasizes the gap between real human assistance and virtual agent assistance, where users have a flexible goal to maximize their utility. This work attempts to develop a dialogue agent that can deal with dynamically changing user goals; Goal driven module (GDM) has been incorporated with the dialog manager (DM) to track user goals and update them accordingly. A Dynamic Goal Driven Dialogue Agent (DGDVA) has been developed by incorporating a Dynamic Goal Driven Module (GDM) on top of a deep reinforcement learning based dialogue manager. In the course of a conversation, the user sentiment provides grounded feedback about agent behavior, including goal serving action. More details and article link will be provided soon.
